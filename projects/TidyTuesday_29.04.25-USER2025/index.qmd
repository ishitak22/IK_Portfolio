# useR! 2025 Keyword Network

This interactive project explores how keywords were used across sessions at the **useR! 2025** conference. The goal was to analyse and visualise how topics clustered together using text mining and network analysis techniques.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Data Preparation

This analysis used the following R libraries:

-   `tidyverse` for data manipulation
-   `tidytext` for splitting keywords and keyword processing
-   `widyr` for calculating pairwise keyword co-occurrence
-   `ggraph`, `igraph`, and `tidygraph` for network visualization
-   `shiny` for interactivity

To prepare the data:

-   The dataset was cleaned by **separating comma-separated keywords** into individual rows
-   Extra whitespace and missing values were removed
-   Session-level keyword groupings were constructed using `unite()` and `pairwise_count()`
-   The final result was a **co-occurrence network**, where nodes are keywords and edges represent how often they appeared together in a session
