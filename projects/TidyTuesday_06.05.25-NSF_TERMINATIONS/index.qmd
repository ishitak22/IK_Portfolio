# NSF Grant Terminations

This interactive Shiny app explores patterns in **early terminations of NSF-funded research projects**. The analysis focuses on both individual project timelines and geographical trends across U.S. states. 

Key questions investigated:

- How early do grants typically terminate?
- Do certain directorates have more early terminations?
- Which states and organizations are affected the most?

---

## Grant Termination Timeline

### Question  
*How long do NSF projects typically run before termination, and how early are they ended relative to their planned duration?*

### Approach

- Built an interactive **Gantt chart**
- Users select a directorate to view its projects
- Start = project start date  
- End = actual termination date  
- Dotted line = expected end date

## Termination Hotspots Across U.S. States

### Question  
*Which U.S. states had the highest number of terminated NSF grants?*

### Approach

- Created a choropleth **heatmap** of terminations by state
- Users can click on a state to see a bar chart of organizations with terminations
