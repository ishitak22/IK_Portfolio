# Royal Flying Doctor Service (RFDS) Analysis

This project investigates the patterns in flight arrivals at **RFDS bases across Australia** using flight logs from July 2022.

Two core visual explorations are included:

 - **Bar Chart** of flight arrivals categorised by time of day (Day vs Night)
 - **Interactive Map** of base activity and aircraft operations using Leaflet

## Flight Arrivals by Time of the Day

We first examine RFDS flights landing at bases in Queensland, grouped by aircraft and arrival timestamps.
