## 🌍 Global Measles Analysis --- TidyTuesday 25-06-2025

This project investigates global measles outbreak data using the [TidyTuesday 20-06-2025 dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/main/data/2025/2025-06-24). Using WHO provisional reports from 2015--2025, the analysis highlights vulnerable countries, under-reported outbreaks, and population-level immunisation challenges.

## Key Features

 - 🔥 **Seasonal Heatmap** of monthly outbreak patterns for top countries.
 - 🫧 **Bubble Chart** showing vaccine coverage gaps for large populations
 - 🕸️**Scatter Plot** to detect under-reporting by comparing incidence and totals

## Key Insights

 - Seasonal patterns show distinct outbreak peaks across regions, supporting the need for region-specific vaccination timing.

 - High-incidence countries like Madagascar, Mongolia, and Kyrgyzstan had relatively low total case counts, suggesting possible under-reporting.

 - The scatter plot revealed several countries with inconsistent surveillance, highlighting a gap in global health reporting systems.

 - Countries with low vaccine coverage and large populations — such as Nigeria and Pakistan — are critical priorities for public health interventions.

 - The bubble chart enabled identification of outlier regions where vaccine programs may not be translating into coverage or protection, warranting further investigation.
