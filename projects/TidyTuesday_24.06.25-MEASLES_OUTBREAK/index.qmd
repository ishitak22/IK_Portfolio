## 🌍 Global Measles Analysis — TidyTuesday 25-06-2025

This project investigates global measles outbreak data using the [TidyTuesday 2025-06-24 dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/main/data/2025/2025-06-24). Using WHO provisional reports from 2015–2025, the analysis highlights vulnerable countries, under-reported outbreaks, and population-level immunisation challenges.
