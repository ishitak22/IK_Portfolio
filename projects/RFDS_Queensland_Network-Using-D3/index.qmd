# RFDS Flight Network in Queensland

This D3.js project explores **Royal Flying Doctor Service (RFDS)** flight routes and base activity **within Queensland**, using flight logs from July 2022.

The map highlights:

 - **Red nodes**: RFDS bases
 - **Blue node**: Brisbane - no incoming or outgoing of flights from this base
 - **Lines**: Flight paths
 - **Tooltip**: It shows detailed info i.e. no. of arrivals, departures, distances, flight count
 - **Path thickness**: Representing amount of trips on that path
 - **Node thickness**: Based on traffic at that location/base
