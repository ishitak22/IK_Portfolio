Hi, I'm **Ishita Khanna**, a data analyst with a focus on creating clear, insightful and impactful data-driven solutions.

I approach data projects with a blend of analytical thinking, attention to detail, and a user focused mindset, Whether it's exploring open datasets, designing dashboards, or building end-to-end workflows, I enjoy finding meaningful patterns and communicating results effectively.

This portfolio highlights some of my recent work from the [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) community and will continue to grow with academic, personal, and applied projects. 

I'm always open to learning new techniques, tools and domains and excited to contribute wherever data can make a difference.
