## Where Data Meets Design

Mysticase is a small creative side business I co-launched on Etsy to explore how analytics and design come together in real-world ecommerce.

As a side project, Mysticase allowed me to use the analytical skills I gained during my Master's to explore the intersection of design, data, and online retail.

## What I did as part of Mysticase:

- Created all product imagery with design tools and automated mockup generation.  
- Used **Etsy SEO** strategies including keyword testing, titles, and tags.  
- Regularly reviewed analytics to improve conversion and discover trends.  
- Used **Google Trends** and **Etsy search data** to target low-competition niches.
- Built lightweight workflows to automate Etsy listing creation and dynamic pricing updates.

*This initiative was a fun, self-directed application of the skills I developed during my data analytics Master's â€” and a way to keep learning creatively outside work.*
